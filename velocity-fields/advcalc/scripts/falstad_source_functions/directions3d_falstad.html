    <p>
    This applet demonstrates various properties of
    <a href="http://www.barcodesinc.com/articles/resource-guide-to-vector-calculus.htm">vector fields</a>.
    You can select from a number of vector fields and see how
    particles move if it is treated as either a velocity
    or a force field.  This helps you visualize the field.
    <p>
    When you start the applet, you will see 500 particles moving in the
    <tt>"1/r^2 single"</tt> field, which is a field that attracts
    particles to the center.  By default the
    particles are treating the field as a <i>velocity</i> field, which means
    that the field vectors determine how fast the particles are moving and in
    what direction.  In this case, the particles just move toward the center.
    The velocity of all the particles at a certain point
    on the grid is always the same.  If the field is a <i>force</i> field, then the
    field vectors determine the acceleration of the particles, but their velocity
    may vary depending on where they started.
    <p>
    The <b>Field Selection</b> popup will allow you to select a
    vector field.  The choices are:
    <ul>
        <li><b>1/r^2 single</b>:
            This field is associated with gravity and electrostatic attraction.
            The gravitational field around a planet and the electric field
            around a single point charge are similar to this field.
            The field points towards the origin and is inversely proportional
            to the square of the distance from the origin.

                <li><b>1/r^2 double</b>:
                    This field is associated with gravity and electrostatic attraction.
                    The gravitational field around two planets and the electric field
                    around two negative point charges are similar to this field.
                    The separation of the two centers is adjustable.
                    <li><b>1/r single line</b>:
                        This field is associated with electrostatic attraction.
                        If we calculate the electric field around an infinitely long conductor
                        in a straight line with a uniform charge along its length, we find that
                        the field strength is
                        inversely related to the distance from the line.

                            <li><b>1/r double lines</b>:
                                This is the field around two infinitely long conductors.  The distance
                                between them is adjustable.
                                <li><b>1/r rotational</b>:
                                    In this field, the particle is being pulled in a circle around the
                                    center line.  The speed of its motion is inversely proportional to its
                                    distance from the line.
                                    If we calculate the magnetic field around an infinitely long conductor
                                    in a straight line with a uniform current along its length, we find that
                                    the field strength is
                                    inversely related to the distance from the line.

    <p>
    The <b>Display</b> popup will allow you to select how the field
    is displayed:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Display: Particles (Vel.)</b> means particles will move through
            the field, with the field vectors determining their velocity.
            Note that the particles are only a educational device
            intended to show what the field looks like;
            in real life, particles would not move in this manner.
            <li><b>Display: Particles (Force)</b> means particles will move through
                the field, and the field vectors determine their acceleration.
                <li><b>Display: Field Vectors</b> shows you the field vectors at an array
                    of locations.
                    <li><b>Display: Streamlines</b> shows you the streamlines.  The
                        <b>Line Density</b> slider controls how many streamlines to draw.  The
                        color indicates the field strength.
                        <li><b>Display: Equipotentials</b> shows you equipotential surfaces.
                            By default slicing is turned on because the equipotentials are easier
                            to see that way, and you can see more than one at a time.  Red means
                            negative potential, green means positive, gray means ground.  If you
                            turn slicing off, you can only see one equipotential at a time;
                            the <b>Potential</b> slider allows you to determine which one to
                            view.  If the slider is set too high or too low then the corresponding
                            equipotential surface may not be visible or may not exist, so just
                            play around with the slider a bit if you don't see anything.
    </ul>
    <p>
    The <b>Mouse</b> popup controls what happens when you click on the box.
    If you set it to <b>Adjust Angle</b> or <b>Adjust Zoom</b>, you can
    adjust the orientation or size of the 3-d view by clicking and
    dragging on the box.
    <p>
    The <b>Slice</b> popup allows you to look at planar slices of the box
    rather than looking at the contents of the entire box.
    If the popup is set to <b>No Slicing</b>, you view the entire
    box.  Otherwise you will see the box sliced in one of three
    directions.  The location of the slice can be adjusted by dragging
    the line running along the sides of box near the slice.
    <p>
    The <b>Stopped</b> checkbox will stop the particles.
    <p>
    The <b>Reverse</b> checkbox will reverse the direction of all the
    field vectors.
    <p>
    The <b>Reset</b> button can be used to reset the positions of
    all the particles to random values.
    <p>
    The <b>Kick</b> button can be used to give all the particles a
    random acceleration in some direction. 
    This is only allowed if the particle movement is set
    to "Force".  It can be useful if none of the particles are moving,
    or if they are all moving in the same direction.
    <p>
    The <b>Field Strength</b> slider makes the field stronger or weaker,
    and also adjusts the brightness of the field vectors if you
    have <b>Display: Field Vectors</b> selected.
    <p>
    The <b>Vector Density</b> slider controls the number of vectors present
    if you have <b>Display: Field Vectors</b> selected.
    <p>
    The <b>Number of Particles</b> slider allows you to reduce the number
    of particles, which can be useful if you want to watch the behavior of
    just a few of them.  Also it might speed things up if you have fewer
    particles.
    <p>
    A few additional field-specific sliders may be present,
    depending on the field you have selected.
